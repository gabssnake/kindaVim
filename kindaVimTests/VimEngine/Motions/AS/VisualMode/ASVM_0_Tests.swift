// two things here:

//    would have a count of 80 rather than the 0 move. 0 should only happen as a Vim move
//    if there is no previous digits in the count buffers.
// 2. there's no test for the count because it's not possible to force a count before a 0
//    being considered as a Vim move. the count should always be nil before a 0, else the 0 would
//    be part of the count rathern than a Vim move. (although in the impl we forcing the
//    count reset, just for precaution.)
