// yeah so we not gonna bother with this, at least not at first
// this would be for when the AX fails and the KS should take over
// which should never happen LOL
// we still take care of it in the KVE by calling the KS method when the AX
// fails, but testing it for all the moves doesn't make sense. at least not now.
